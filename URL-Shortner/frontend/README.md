what we were previously doing was stateless architecture.
Basically tokens shared between [React] <---> [Node] is stateless, that means token doesnt need to store in db. but in statefull tokens shared between [React] <---> [Node] <--->  [DB] when token are stored inside db.
 
JWT - microservices, cannot delete session that why we use refreh token policy

### JWT Authentication Flow

- `jwt.verify()` checks if the **access token** is present and valid.  
- If the **access token** is **valid** â†’ the user is allowed to enter the website.  
- If the **access token** is **expired** â†’ it then checks if a **refresh token** is present. but for access token it wont compare direclty give access to the user!  
- If the **refresh token** is **valid** â†’  
  - `jwt.verify` verifies the refresh token.  
  - Then it compares the refresh token with the one stored in the database.  
- If the **refresh token** is also **expired** â†’  
  - The user must re-enter their credentials.  
  - Logging in again will generate a **new access token** and **refresh token**.  
  - These are saved in the cookie, and the **old refresh token** in the database is updated with the new one.  

âš¡ In any case, the **access token** and **refresh token** are never removed from the cookie until new ones are issued to replace them.
